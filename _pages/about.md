[Real-time Transportation Prediction Correction using Reconstruction Error in Deep Learning, TKDD 2020]

**SHUAI LIU**, GUOJIE SONG, WENHAO HUANG
  
We propose traffic prediction correction strategy using the reconstruction error in the deep neural network. The reconstruction error can reflect the model’s ability on feature representation and then determine the fitness of an input data to the model. We propose two mechanisms of real-time prediction correction using this reconstruction error: the data driven approach and the model-driven approach.
