Hi, this is Shuai Liu (刘帅）, a second-year Phd student at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore. I am under the supervision of Professor Cong Gao. My research focus is on spatial-temporal data mining, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Before joining NTU, I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in computer science at Peking University in China, under the guidance of Professor Guojie Song.

# ♥ News
My paper 'Multivariate Time-series imputation with disentangled representations' has been accepted to ICLR 2023.

[Multivariate Time-series imputation with disentangled representations]

**SHUAI LIU**, XIUCHENG LI, GAO CONG, YILE CHEN, YUE JIANG
  
We propose TIDER, a novel matrix factorization-based method with disentangled temporal representations that account for multiple factors, namely trend, seasonality, and local bias, to model complex dynamics. The learned disen- tanglement makes the imputation process more reliable and offers explainability for imputation results.

[Real-time Transportation Prediction Correction using Reconstruction Error in Deep Learning, TKDD 2020]

**SHUAI LIU**, GUOJIE SONG, WENHAO HUANG
  
We propose traffic prediction correction strategy using the reconstruction error in the deep neural network. The reconstruction error can reflect the model’s ability on feature representation and then determine the fitness of an input data to the model. We propose two mechanisms of real-time prediction correction using this reconstruction error: the data driven approach and the model-driven approach.
